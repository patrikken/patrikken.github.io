Here is short list of those clusters:\n\nGraham\nCedar\nNarval\nBeluga\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCluster Names\n\n\n\nThe names of the clusters are chosen based some facts about the location of the cluster. For example, Beluga, located at École de technologie supérieure in Montreal, is named after the Beluga whale, which is found in the St. Lawrence River.\n\n\nThe name of the cluster is used to login to a specific cluster. For example, to login to the Beluga cluster, you can use the following command:\nssh &lt;your_username&gt;@beluga.alliancecan.ca"

    "text": "Login nodes vs Compute nodes\nUnlike other cloud providers, login via ssh to a node does not give direct access to a compute machine. Instead, you will be on a login node from which you can submit jobs to the compute nodes.\n\nLogin nodes\nOnce you are logged in to the cluster, you will be on a login node. Login nodes are meant for interactive use and are not meant for running your large programs.\nThings you can do on the login nodes:\n\nGit clone your repository\nRun small interactive jobs (will be discussed below)\nEdit and submit jobs using a text editor\nView the status of your jobs\nTransfer files to and from the cluster\nCreate virtual environments and install packages\nSubmit jobs to the cluster (will be assigned to a compute node)\n\nThings you cannot do on the login nodes:\n\nRun large jobs\nUse a lot of memory\nUse a lot of CPU\n\n\n\n\nExample of ssh session on a login node. Login nodes generally have hostnames like beluga1, beluga2, etc.\n\n\n\n\nCompute nodes\nCompute nodes are meant for running large jobs. They have more memory and CPU than login nodes, and they have GPUs.\nWhen you submit a job, it is assigned to a compute node with the requested resources. We will get back to this below. Before that, let’s discuss file systems and where you should copy the files for your project."

    "section": "File System",
    "text": "File System\nOne of the most important thing to know about Compute Canada is the file system. There are three types of file systems with different properties and limitations: home, project, scratch\n Directory structure on Beluga\nThe home directory has small quota, a fixed number of filesystem objects and smaller storage space (generally up to 25 GB) and has dearly backups. The project directory is meant for long-term storage of data that is shared across users linked to a sponsor. The scratch directory is meant for temporary storage of data and has a larger fixed quota per user and a larger storage space (generally above to 2 PB of space).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you are actively working on a project, I recommend that you copy your data (source code, datasets, etc.) to the scratch directory. This will save you time, and you don’t need to worry about the storage space. You can copy your data back to the project directory after your project is done or paused.\n\n\nNote that only the unused files on the scratch directory are deleted after 30 or 60 days, depending on the cluster. So if you are actively working on your project, you can use scratch and run everything as on your local machine, with logs files and results saved in your project directory.\nA better approach is to have your source code and data in the project directory and make sure your logs (e.g., training logs and models’ checkpoints) and results are saved in the scratch directory. This way you can keep your project directory clean and you can have better control of your data. In another post, we will discuss how to speed up jobs using $SLURM_TMPDIR."

    "title": "Getting Started with Compute Clusters",
    "section": "Job Submission",
    "text": "Job Submission\nOnce you have your data in the scratch directory, you can submit a job to the cluster.\n\nModule loading\nBefore running any job, you need to load the modules for the software you need. For example, if you need to use Python 3.10, you need to load the Python module with the following command.\nmodule load python/3.10\nAfter loading the module, you can check if it is loaded correctly by running module list. Note that from here on, all the dependencies you install, with pip install for example, will be installed for this specific version of Python and will be available in your environment every time you load the module.\n\n\nVirtual environment\nAfter loading the module, you can also create a virtual environment for project-specific dependencies.\npython -m venv .venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n\n\nSubmitting a job\nAt this point, you should have your data in the scratch directory, installed the dependencies in your loaded module and created a virtual environment for project-specific dependencies.\nNow you can submit a job to the cluster.\nLet’s assume you have a Python script (my_script.py) that you want to run on the cluster, and you can pass some arguments to it, for example, the number of epochs and the dataset to use, etc. Normally, on your local machine, you run this script as follows:\npython my_script.py --num_epochs 60 --dataset mnist\nTo submit this job to the cluster, you need to create a job script that will be used to submit the job. A job script is a bash program that will load the necessary modules and specify the resources your Python program needs (number of nodes, number of cores, amount of memory, type and number of GPUs, etc.).\n\nJob script directives\nThe header of the job script contains directives to specify the resources your Python program needs. Here is an example of a job script header:\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --account=def-someuser\n#SBATCH --gpus-per-node=1         # Number of GPU(s) per node\n#SBATCH --node=1         # Number of GPU(s) per node\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4         # CPU cores/threads\n#SBATCH --time=00:15:00           # Time limit in hh:mm:ss \n#SBATCH --mem=1024M\n\n#SBATCH --account=def-someuser is the account of your supervisor. To obtain what account you have access to, you can login to CCDB and click on My Account -&gt; My Resources and Allocations\n\n\n\n\nThe illustration above tells you what account you can use on a given cluster. For example, on Cedar, I can submit jobs using #SBATCH --account=def-ebrahimi.\n\n\n\n#SBATCH --gpus-per-node=1 is the number of GPUs per node, in general, you set up 4 GPUs per node. And #SBATCH --node=1 specifies the number of nodes you want to use.\nIf you want to use 2 GPUs per node, you can set #SBATCH --gpus-per-node=2 and #SBATCH --node=1\nIf you want to use 2 nodes with 4 GPUs per node, you can set #SBATCH --gpus-per-node=4 and #SBATCH --node=2, i.e., your job will be using 8 GPUs in total.\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4 is the number of CPU cores per task. This is the number of CPU cores your program will use.\n#SBATCH --time=00:15:00 is the time limit for your job. This is the maximum time your job can run. In general, you don’t know exactly how long your job will run, so you should set a time limit that is long enough to run your job and adjust it later.\n#SBATCH --mem=1024M is the amount of memory your job will use. This is the maximum amount of memory your job can use. You can set it in GB as --mem=32G you request 32 GB of memory. If you are not sure how much memory your job will use, you can set it to a large value and adjust it later."

A log file, named slurm-&lt;job_id&gt;.out, will be created in the main directory of your project.\nYou can check the status of your jobs by running the following command:\nsqueue -u &lt;your_username&gt;\nIn case you want to cancel your job, you can run the following command:\nscancel &lt;job_id&gt;\nIf you want to cancel all your jobs, you can run the following command:\nscancel -u &lt;your_username&gt;"

You can do this by running the following command:\nsalloc --time=00:30:00 --account=def-ebrahimi --mem=48000 --gpus-per-node=4 --cpus-per-task=1\nSimilarly to job scripts, parameters of the salloc command specify the resources you need for your interactive job session.\nThe illustration below shows an interactive job session on the Beluga cluster.\n Interactive job session on the Beluga cluster\nYou can see that salloc moved us from a login node (beluga3) to a compute node (bg12103). This compute node has requested resources, i.e., 4 GPUs, 1 CPU core, 48 GB of memory and 30 minutes of time. However, before running your Python program interactively, you need to type commands to load the module and activate the virtual environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive jobs\n\n\n\nThe more you request resources (time, GPUs, CPU cores, memory), the longer you will wait to get an interactive compute node. You can use them to test your code before submitting a job script.\n\n\nIn the next post, we will discuss how to speed up jobs using $SLURM_TMPDIR."
